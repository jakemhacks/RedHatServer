## Project Documentation
- [OS Setup](/docs/os-setup.md) - Initial installation of RHEL on a Virtual Machine
- [Initial Security Scan and Hardening](/docs/initial-security.md) - This is the initial security scan and hardening
- [Services Hardening](/docs/services-hardening.md) - This was the bulk of the work

## Final Scan
This project took way longer than I expected...several days with researching every change and topic.
So II decided to end the project at 90%. I got a lot of good practice with this project and learned a ton about system hardening and configuration.
